          <h1>Me</h1>
          <p class="me-subtitle">A disciplined athlete turned builder, learning to translate resilience into code and calm leadership.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="me-story">
        <p>
          I was shaped by curiosity, discipline, and the belief that every challenge—big or small—arrives to redirect us toward growth. I didn’t become a builder overnight; it happened through years of asking questions, breaking things, fixing them, and discovering that creation gives me a sense of purpose nothing else does.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m the kind of person who genuinely enjoys learning, improving systems, simplifying complexity, and turning ideas into products that help people in the real world. I like thinking deeply, observing quietly, and building boldly. Technology became my language, and through it I found a way to express creativity, strategy, logic, and empathy all at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          My ambitions are bigger than just code. I want to stand on stages one day—TED, conferences, universities—and talk about resilience, clarity, discipline, and the power of iteration. I want to share how embracing mistakes, uncertainty, and curiosity can turn someone into the best version of themselves. Not because I think I’m “there,” but because I’m committed to the journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe success is not a destination; it’s the repetition of honest effort. It’s waking up every day choosing improvement over comfort, courage over fear, and purpose over noise. I believe in doing things with intention, in staying calm under pressure, in building what matters, and in leading with clarity.
        </p>

        <p>
          My life philosophy is simple:
        </p>

        <p>
          Learn deeply.<br />
          Build boldly.<br />
          Stay humble.<br />
          Move with purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          And whenever I feel lost, I return to a truth that guides everything I do:
        </p>

        <p>
          “You’re always in the best position you could possibly be.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Every moment—good or bad—is a repositioning. A quiet push pushing you toward something better if you’re willing to see it, learn from it, and act.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is who I am:<br />
          A builder.<br />
          A thinker.<br />
          A student of life.<br />
          Someone who wants to create things that outlive him and help people move with clarity and intention.<br />
          Someone committed to turning potential into impact, step by step.
        </p>
